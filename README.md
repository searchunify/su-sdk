## Overview

The SearchUnify SDK enables developers to easily work with the SearchUnify
platform and build scalable solutions with search, analytics, crawlers and more.
You can get started in minutes using NPM. The SearchUnify SDK simplifies use of
SearchUnify Services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and
familiar for the developers. It provides support for API lifecycle consideration
such as credential management, retries, data marshaling, and serialization. The
SearchUnify SDKs also support higher level abstractions for simplified
development.

## Key Features

-   HTTP/2 Support and pluggable HTTP layer, new programming interfaces
    seamlessly take advantage of HTTP/2 features and provide new ways to build
    applications.
-   Nonblocking I/O, the SearchUnify SDK for Javascript utilizes a new,
    nonblocking SDK architecture to support true nonblocking I/O. It features
    truly non blocking asynchronous clients that implement high concurrency
    across a few threads.

        let response = await searchunify.search(req.body);
        return res.json(response);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('Exception ${error.message}');
